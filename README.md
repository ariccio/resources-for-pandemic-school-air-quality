# COVID mitigation advice for schools

Aerosol and IAQ experts are currently inundated with requests to help individual school districts before the reopening of schools. Of course, society has waited until the last minute to address this. This repo is an attempt at coordinating and centralizing expert advice for school districts.

# Background

COVID is an airborne disease. Although major health authorities have in the past denied the airborne transmission of coronavirus, and now obfuscate the roll of airborne transmission, it is a well established scientific fact. Throughout the pandemic, 11 scientists have been maintaining a compendium of this evidence and ways to protect yourself as a google doc, viewable here: [FAQs on Protecting Yourself from COVID-19 Aerosol Transmission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fB5pysccOHvxphpTmCG_TGdytavMmc1cUumn8m0pwzo/edit?usp=sharing). I recommend reading through it before asking questions, some may already be answered :)

# COVID Straight Talk

If you're not familiar with them, they're an excellent group of individuals doing similar work! [Their website has excellent plain-english advice.](https://covidstraighttalk.org/) I will incorporate some of it here. Their central guidance mirrors that of scientists, but in an easily digestable image form:

# Ventilation
#### Target a minimum of ~6 air changes per h
our (ACH) of clean air delivery.
Clean air in this context means air free of virus bearing aprtciles. So it can be a combiantion of outdoor air, filtered recirculated air, and air filtered in situ by portable air cleaners. Delta covid has been documented to transmit at far higher levels of ventilation, so we cannot rely on ventilation as a single control measure.
